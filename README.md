# System analysis with Prolog

Modern large-scale accelerators make use of a complex but robust system to prevent damage occuring due to off-nominal operation.  These systems act by shutting down high-power systems on a timescale shorter than that of the damage mechanism.

This project intends to make use of a logical programming language (i.e. Prolog) to analyse the configuration of such a system.  The hope is that it will shed light on the available operational envelope allowed by the protection system, and perhaps indicate areas where this envelope is unnecessarily restricted.
